Code for the paper **Multimodal Meta-Learning through Meta-Learned Task Representations**
accepted to the Neural Computing and Applications journal (2024).

We propose a meta-learning framework that can handle multimodal task distributions by 
conditioning the model on the current task, resulting in a faster adaptation.
Our proposed method learns to encode each task and generate task embeddings that modulate 
the modelâ€™s activations. The resulting modulated model becomes specialized for the current 
task and leads to more effective adaptation.

# Usage
To run the code, use *regression_train.py* for regression experiments and
*classification_train.py* file for classification experiments. 
Results in the paper are obtained using the "Conditioning with sigmoid" method, but
other conditioning approaches can be found in the training files.

For testing use *regression_eval.py* and *classification_eval.py*.
